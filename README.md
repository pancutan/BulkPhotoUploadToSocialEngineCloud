# Bulk Photo Upload to Social Engine Cloud
## Social Engine Cloud does not provide a mechanism to make a first bulk upload of galleries.
Ir order to pre populate your categories, with this script you can upload as many photos / pictures you want.

You need to install ruby 2.3, rspec, and the gems which figure at top of program.
Also, you may need to provide a webdriver controller from Selenium web page

In Arch/Manjaro, I simply installed from AUR, google-chrome-stable and chromedriver packages.

To ejecute this program, you should run it with rspec. Not with a ruby interpreter. Install it with gem.

To debug, learn how to use Pry or byebug. If Social Engine change any on his default template or you has made modifications, use SeleniumIDE to generate your own macros and export them as Ruby Rspec Test Cases. Then, study my code and merge with your own.
